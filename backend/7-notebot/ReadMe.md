## Redesigned NoteBot application from the ELAS platform

#### This is a student for students project of the Praxisprojekt IDEA from the University of Duisburg-Essen to develop an app called "NoteBot" which is already existing at the Exploratory Learning Analytics Toolkit for Students (ELAS) platform.

We - The Innovators - wanted to make the app work better for students in their daily life. 
The goal to achieve this was to keep the structure of the web application simple and clean. 
Therefore we did a Cognitive Walkthrough early in our process to detect the issues and good parts of the existing system.
From that point we developed ideas how we could improve the Notebot-application and tried to figure out how these ideas could be implemented in real coding.
So we had to learn a lot and we encountered some obstacles, but in the end we did our best and are now happy to share our results with you!


## Our used libraries and toolkits are:

#### Visual Studio Code
for coding and sharing in GitHub

#### Material UI
to implement our design elements and components into the code

#### Mongo DB and Postman
for the backend code

#### CodeSandbox
to test the frontend code

#### YouTube, CodePal and ChatGPT
to help us to understand the already existing codes

#### Trello, WhatsApp and Zoom
for communication, organization and meetings
