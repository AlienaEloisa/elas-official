## Notebot application

#### This is a student for students project of the Praxisprojekt IDEA from the University of Duisburg-Essen to develop an app which is already existing.

We - The Innovators - wanted to make the app work for students in their daily life. 
The goal to achieve this was to keep the structure of the web application simple and clean. 
Therefore we did a Cognitive Walkthrough early in our process to detect the issues and good parts of the existing system.
From that point we developed ideas how we could improve the Notebot-application and tried to figure out how these ideas could be implemented in real coding.
So we had to learn a lot and we encountered some obstacles, but in the end we did our best and are now happy to share our results with you!
